# Oddjob

An engagement data store for penetration testing: projects, targets,
services, findings, captured web traffic and reports — with an agent and
an MCP server so a model can read and write it directly.

FastAPI + SQLAlchemy behind a React/MUI UI. SQLite by default, PostgreSQL
when you need concurrent writers.

```bash
# API, which also serves the built UI
cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# UI in dev mode, hot reload, /api proxied to the backend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

First run creates the admin account; every route after that needs a
session.

## What it is for

A real engagement produces a scanner file here, a proxy history there, a
finding in someone's notes. Oddjob is where those land so that "what do
we know about this host" has one answer.

- **Import** nmap, masscan, Nessus, Metasploit, Burp (issues *and* proxy
  history), Nikto, Nuclei, httpx, and five C2 frameworks. Formats are
  detected from the file.
- **One row per captured exchange**, not per URL — the same endpoint
  probed ten ways is ten pieces of evidence, and the differences between
  the responses are usually the finding. The UI groups them back under
  the URL.
- **Replay** any captured request after editing it. The result is stored
  as a new exchange beside the original.
- **Report** to PDF or DOCX, optionally with an agent pass over the prose.
- **Notify** Slack: findings as one-liners with the detail in-thread, plus
  engagement, import, membership and report events.

## Targets come in three kinds

| kind | identified by | address | liveness |
|---|---|---|---|
| `host` | FQDN or IP | yes | meaningful |
| `mobile` | bundle / package id | **N/A** | **N/A** |
| `cloud` | whatever the provider uses — hostname, ARN, resource path | optional | meaningful |

The distinction is not cosmetic. A blank IP on a *host* means "not
resolved yet" — a gap in our coverage. On a mobile app it means there is
nothing to resolve. Recording which is which is what stops an app
appearing in a report as an unscanned server.

## Importing at scale

The importers stream. A 2.5 GB Burp proxy history — 357,276 transactions
across 1,611 hosts — parses in about 9 seconds at a flat ~360 MB, and
imports as a background job that survives closing the tab.

Two rules worth knowing:

- **Only open ports are recorded.** A UDP probe with no reply is
  indistinguishable from one a firewall dropped, and a closed TCP port is
  a reply saying nothing is there. One `-sU` sweep produced 42,890
  `open|filtered` rows against 13 genuinely open ports.
- **Strict mode by default.** An import only writes to hosts the project
  already has, and reports the rest for a decision. The file is held
  server-side while you decide, so answering costs a few hundred bytes
  rather than a second upload.

## Running on PostgreSQL

SQLite takes one writer at a time, which a long import and a background
worker will fight over. For concurrent use:

```bash
docker run -d --name oddjob-pg -e POSTGRES_USER=oddjob \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=... -e POSTGRES_DB=oddjob \
  -v oddjob-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 127.0.0.1:5433:5432 postgres:17

export ODDJOB_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://oddjob:...@127.0.0.1:5433/oddjob
cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run python pgcopy.py --to "$ODDJOB_DATABASE_URL"   # existing data, optional
```

The DSN is an environment variable, not a setting: the settings table
lives inside the database, so a connection string stored there could not
be read until the connection it describes was already open.

## The agent

Configure a provider in Site Config and the agent can answer questions
about an engagement, draft remediation for findings one at a time, and —
over Slack Socket Mode — reply when someone @-mentions it. It is
read-only unless writes are explicitly enabled, and scoped to a single
engagement: a question asked in one channel cannot be answered with
another's data.

Socket Mode means the app opens the connection outward, so nothing has to
be exposed to the internet.

## Tests

```bash
cd backend && uv run python runtests.py          # all suites
cd backend && uv run python runtests.py webtest  # one

cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit && node test/hooks.check.mjs
```

Each backend suite gets its own server and its own database. They refuse
to run against `ODDJOB_DATABASE_URL`, so a shell with the production DSN
exported cannot point them at real data.

## Layout

```
backend/app/          FastAPI application
  importers/          one module per tool, sharing one intermediate form
  agent/              providers, tools, remediation worker
  reports/            templates, rendering, background runner
  slack.py            outbound notifications
  slack_socket.py     inbound, over Socket Mode
backend/alembic/      migrations
frontend/src/         React UI
docs/reference.md     the long version of all of this
```
